<p>Hi and welcome to the FoodTiger supermarkets Power BI fundamentals course!</p>
<p>My name is Remus and I will be your instructor throughout this course that will boost your data-driven decision making skills by leveraging on data visualization</p>
<p>The key objective of the course is to enable you to take decisions with confidence using visual insights by following a data-driven framework.</p>
<p>You will be able to answer questions like: how to boost my sales, which products to promote or how clients decide what to buy AND THEN ACT based on this answers.</p>
<p>The course is divided into 4 chapters</p>
<p>Let's now deep-dive into the first chapter</p>
<p>Hi and welcome to the first chapter!</p>
<p>In this first chapter you will learn what Power BI is and how it can be used to generate visual insights with your data.</p>
<p>You will do this gradually, first finding out: What are the key components and building blocks of Power BI Afterwards, you will the explore Power BI most used visualizations and learn which one should be used when Then, at the end of the chapter, you will already be able to create you first visualizations in Power BI</p>
<p>But first, let’s start with the answer to the first question: What is Power BI and what can it be used for?</p>
<p>Power BI is a business analytics service developed by Microsoft.</p>
<p>At FoodTiger supermarkets we use it to provide interactive data visualizations and business intelligence capabilities with an interface simple enough for end users to create their own reports and dashboards.</p>
<p>It enables you to interactively explore data to get insights via easy-to-use visualizations.</p>
<p>Visually representing data enables you to identify patterns and take decision fast.</p>
<p>At FoodTiger supermarkets we use Power BI to ingest data from different sources and then visually represent this data.</p>
<p>This data from multiple sources is then transformed into: Monthly sales evolution Which you can then drill-down on a product line basis OR analyze most frequently used payment method</p>
<p>Now that you are more familiar with Power BI, let’s now explore what are the key building blocks.</p>
<p>After you understand these building blocks, you can expand on each of them and begin creating elaborate and complex reports</p>
<p>This building blocks are:</p>
<p>Visualizations Datasets Reports Dashboards</p>
<p>Let’s now tackle each of these building blocks and explain what they refer to.</p>
<p>Visualization - sometimes also referred to as a visual - is a visual representation of data, like a chart, a color-coded map, or other interesting things you can create to represent your data visually. Power BI has all sorts of visualization types, and more are coming all the time.</p>
<p>The image you see right now shows a collection of different visualizations that were created in the Power BI.</p>
<p>A dataset is a collection of data that Power BI uses to create its visualizations.</p>
<p>At FoodTiger we use data from mainly 2 sources:</p>
<p>From our SQL data warehouse (where we store sales per each store and sku AND also keep inventory) Or from different Excel files (where we store client feedback gathered in-store)</p>
<p>A dashboard is a single screen with interactive visuals, text, and graphics. A dashboard collects your most important metrics, on one screen, to tell a story or answer a question. The dashboard content comes from one or more reports and one or more datasets.</p>
<p>A dashboard is a single canvas that has tiles, graphics, and text.</p>
<p>A report is one or more pages of interactive visuals, text, and graphics that together make up a single report. Power BI bases a report on a single dataset. Often, the designer organizes report pages to address a central area of interest or answer a single question.</p>
